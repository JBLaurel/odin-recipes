        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            A simple, rustic loaf, the basic sourdough is great for everything from avocado toast to PB&J. The wet dough lends itself to a cavernous, moist inside while still maintaining a robust and crisp outer crust. The basic sourdough should be every new sourdough-baker's first loaf!
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>340g (57%) of water</li>
            <li>227g (38%) of fed starter</li>
            <li>600g of AP flour</li>
            <li>15g (2.5%) of salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the fed starter and water in a large bowl (or better yet a stand mixer bowl) and mix until the starter is dissolved</li>
            <li>Add the flour and lightly mix by hand or stand mixer until combined.</li>
            <li>Allow dough to rest for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add salt and knead by hand (20-30 minutes) or using your stand mixer's dough hook (8-10 minutes).</li>
            <li>allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 24-48 hours, or in the fridge for at least 3 days. The dough will not double in size like a traditional yeast-leavened bread.</li>
            <li>1-2 hours before baking, place a dutch oven in your oven and preheat to 500 degrees.</li>
            <li>Once the oven and dutch oven are thoroughly pre-heated, add the loaf to the dutch oven and cover with the lid.</li>
            <li>After 15 minutes, reduce the oven to 425 degrees.</li>
            <li>After 15 further minutes (30 minutes total), remove the lid from the dutch oven. Continue cooking for an additional 10-20 minutes until the crust is golden brown and the internal temperature of the loaf is 190 degrees.</li>
            <li>Rest until cooled, and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
