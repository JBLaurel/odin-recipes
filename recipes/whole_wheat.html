        <h1>Whole Wheat Sourdough Loaf</h1>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            With the inclusion of an oil, and the use of a loaf pan instead of a dutch oven, this sourdough is great for all your sandwich needs! The use of whole wheat flour instead of white flour lower the glycemic index of this bread and gives you an additional boost of fiber!

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>340g (75%) of water</li>
            <li>100g (22%) of fed starter</li>
            <li>450g of whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>27g (6%) of olive oil</li>
            <li>25g (6%) of honey</li>
            <li>10g (2%) of salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the fed starter and water in a large bowl (or better yet a stand mixer bowl) and mix until the starter is dissolved</li>
            <li>Add the flour, oil, honey, and salt and knead by hand (20-30 minutes) or using your stand mixer's dough hook (8-10 minutes).</li>
            <li>allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 3 hours. The dough will not double in size like a traditional yeast-leavened bread.</li>
            <li>Punch down the dough and place in a loaf pan, allowing to bench rest for a further 1-2 hours</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees</li>
            <li>Bake your loaf for 30 minutes, or until golden and an internal temperature of 190 degrees.</li>
            <li>Rest until cooled, and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
